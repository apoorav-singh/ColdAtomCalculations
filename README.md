# ColdAtomCalculations
## Introduction
This repository contains the routines for analyzing the data from a cold atom-based experiment, such as atom number calculation, temperature measurement of a MOT, etc. This is a work-in-progress project. The project is written in Python, and if any source is used in the writing, the code used will be mentioned in the corresponding code, and the write-up will be in the README section.

## Requirements


# Atom number calculations

## Magneto-optical trapped atoms density calculations

# Temprature measrurement
